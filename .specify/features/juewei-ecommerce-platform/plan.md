# Implementation Plan: Juewei E-commerce Platform

**Branch**: `juewei-ecommerce-platform` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `.specify/features/juewei-ecommerce-platform/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a comprehensive e-commerce platform for Juewei (绝味) using Next.js, Supabase, and Stripe. The platform enables customers to browse products, manage accounts, place orders, and complete payments online with support for both online payment and cash-on-pickup options, multi-language support (Chinese/English), and responsive design.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, JavaScript ES2022  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 15.x, React 19.x, Supabase, Stripe, TailwindCSS  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL database  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright  
**Target Platform**: Web application (desktop and mobile responsive)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js full-stack)  
**Performance Goals**: 1000 concurrent users, <1s page load, <5s checkout completion  
**Constraints**: PCI compliance for payments, mobile-first responsive design, bilingual support  
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ products, 1k+ concurrent users, multi-language content management  

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance

✅ **Library-First**: E-commerce components will be built as reusable libraries (product catalog, cart, checkout, user management)

✅ **CLI Interface**: Admin functionality will include CLI tools for product management and order processing

✅ **Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: TDD mandatory for all e-commerce flows (user registration, product browsing, cart management, checkout, payment processing)

✅ **Integration Testing**: Focus on payment processing, user authentication, order management, and multi-language content delivery

✅ **Observability**: Structured logging for order tracking, payment processing, and user behavior analytics

### Security & Compliance Gates

✅ **PCI Compliance**: Stripe integration ensures secure payment processing
✅ **Data Encryption**: User data and payment information encrypted at rest and in transit
✅ **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with Supabase Auth
✅ **Multi-language**: Static translation system for Chinese/English support

**Structure Decision**: Next.js App Router structure with feature-based component organization. This provides clear separation of concerns, supports the multi-language requirements, and enables efficient development of the e-commerce platform.
