# Tasks: Juewei E-commerce Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `.specify/features/juewei-ecommerce-platform/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach - tests are included for all critical e-commerce flows

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: Next.js App Router structure with `src/` at repository root
- Paths follow the plan.md structure: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `tests/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create Next.js project structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
- [x] T003 [P] Install and configure TailwindCSS in tailwind.config.js

- [x] T012 Create project README with setup instructions

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T013 Setup Supabase database schema with all tables in supabase/migrations/
- [x] T014 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware.ts
- [x] T015 [P] Create base database utilities in src/lib/db.ts
- [x] T016 [P] Setup API routing structure in src/app/api/
- [x] T017 [P] Create base TypeScript types in src/types/index.ts
- [x] T018 [P] Implement error handling utilities in src/lib/errors.ts
- [x] T019 [P] Setup logging infrastructure in src/lib/logger.ts
- [x] T020 [P] Create base UI components in src/components/ui/
- [x] T021 [P] Setup internationalization files in public/locales/
- [x] T022 Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- [x] T023 Setup Stripe webhook handling in src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (authentication) and US2 (products)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (authentication) and US3 (cart)
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (authentication) and US4 (orders)
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 (authentication) and US2 (products)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for user registration in tests/components/auth/register.test.tsx"
Task: "Unit test for user login in tests/components/auth/login.test.tsx"
Task: "Integration test for authentication flow in tests/integration/auth.test.ts"
Task: "E2E test for complete user registration journey in tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create User model types in src/types/user.ts"
Task: "Create Address model types in src/types/address.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 5 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Authentication)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Product Catalog)
5. Complete Phase 7: User Story 5 (Payment Integration)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core e-commerce flow independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Authentication MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Product Catalog MVP!)
4. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Payment MVP!)
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Cart MVP!)
6. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Order Management MVP!)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Admin MVP!)
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Authentication)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Product Catalog)
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (Payment Integration)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 157
**Tasks per User Story**:
- Setup: 12 tasks
- Foundational: 12 tasks
- User Story 1 (Authentication): 24 tasks
- User Story 2 (Product Catalog): 23 tasks
- User Story 3 (Shopping Cart): 19 tasks
- User Story 4 (Order Management): 18 tasks
- User Story 5 (Payment Integration): 16 tasks
- User Story 6 (Admin): 20 tasks
- Polish: 14 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 89 tasks can run in parallel
**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has clear test criteria
**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Stories 1, 2, and 5 (Authentication, Product Catalog, Payment Integration)
