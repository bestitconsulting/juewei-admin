# Research: Juewei E-commerce Platform

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Feature**: Juewei E-commerce Platform  
**Purpose**: Technical decisions and implementation research for e-commerce platform

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 15.x with App Router  
**Rationale**: 
- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization (critical for e-commerce)
- Built-in API routes for backend functionality
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Strong ecosystem for e-commerce applications
- Built-in image optimization for product images

**Alternatives considered**: 
- React with Vite (less SEO optimization)
- Vue.js with Nuxt (smaller ecosystem for e-commerce)
- SvelteKit (less mature for complex e-commerce features)

### Backend & Database
**Decision**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Supabase Auth  
**Rationale**:
- Real-time capabilities for order tracking
- Built-in authentication with email/phone support
- PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Built-in API generation from database schema

**Alternatives considered**:
- Firebase (less SQL flexibility, vendor lock-in)
- Custom Node.js backend (more development overhead)
- MongoDB (less ACID compliance for financial data)

### Payment Processing
**Decision**: Stripe with webhook integration  
**Rationale**:
- PCI compliance built-in
- Excellent developer experience
- Strong fraud protection
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Webhook support for order status updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- PayPal (less developer-friendly API)
- Square (more limited international support)
- Custom payment gateway (PCI compliance complexity)

### Styling & UI
**Decision**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components  
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- shadcn/ui provides accessible, customizable components
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Mobile-first responsive design support
- Consistent design system

**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI (less customization flexibility)
- Chakra UI (smaller component library)
- Custom CSS (more development time)

## Authentication Strategy

### Multi-Method Authentication
**Decision**: Support both email and phone number authentication  
**Rationale**:
- Accommodates different user preferences
- Phone authentication common in Chinese market
- Supabase Auth supports both methods natively
- Reduces registration friction

**Implementation**:
- Email/password registration and login
- Phone number/SMS authentication
- Password reset via email or SMS
- Account linking for users with both email and phone

## Order Management System

### Order Status Tracking
**Decision**: Basic status levels (Ordered, Processing, Ready, Completed)  
**Rationale**:
- Simple enough for customers to understand
- Sufficient for business operations
- Reduces complexity in implementation
- Clear communication of order progress

**Status Flow**:
1. **Ordered**: Order created, payment pending
2. **Processing**: Payment confirmed, order being prepared
3. **Ready**: Order ready for pickup
4. **Completed**: Order picked up or delivered

## Inventory Management

### No Inventory Integration
**Decision**: Assume all products are always in stock  
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies initial implementation
- Reduces external system dependencies
- Allows focus on core e-commerce functionality
- Can be enhanced later with inventory system integration

**Implementation**:
- All products show as available
- No stock level checking
- Admin can mark products as unavailable
- Future enhancement: integrate with inventory system

## Multi-Language Support

### Static Translation System
**Decision**: Hardcoded translations with separate content files  
**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation for initial version
- Better performance (no database queries for translations)
- Easier to maintain and version control
- Can be upgraded to dynamic system later

**Implementation**:
- Separate translation files for Chinese and English
- React i18n library for language switching
- Static content files for product descriptions
- Admin interface for content management

## Payment Integration

### Stripe + Cash on Pickup
**Decision**: Stripe for online payments, cash option for pickup  
**Rationale**:
- Stripe provides secure online payment processing
- Cash on pickup reduces payment friction
- Supports different customer preferences
- Future extensibility for additional payment methods

**Implementation**:
- Stripe Checkout for online payments
- Cash on pickup option in checkout flow
- Payment method selection in order process
- Webhook handling for payment status updates

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Targets
**Decision**: 1000 concurrent users, <1s page load, <5s checkout  
**Rationale**:
- Supports expected user load
- Ensures good user experience
- Meets e-commerce performance standards
- Allows for growth

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Next.js Image optimization
- Database query optimization
- CDN for static assets
- Caching for product data
- Lazy loading for non-critical components

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
**Decision**: End-to-end encryption with Supabase RLS  
**Rationale**:
- Protects user data and payment information
- Complies with data protection regulations
- Row Level Security prevents unauthorized access
- Stripe handles PCI compliance

**Implementation**:
- HTTPS for all communications
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure authentication flows
- Payment data never stored locally
- Regular security audits

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright  
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- TDD approach for reliability

**Testing Coverage**:
- User authentication flows
- Product browsing and search
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Payment processing
- Order management
- Multi-language support

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Hosting Strategy
**Decision**: Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend  
**Rationale**:
- Vercel optimized for Next.js applications
- Supabase provides managed database and auth
- Automatic scaling and deployment
- Built-in CI/CD capabilities
- Global CDN for performance

**Infrastructure**:
- Vercel for application hosting
- Supabase for database and authentication
- Stripe for payment processing
- Cloudflare for additional CDN
- SSL certificates for security

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Dynamic Content Management**: Upgrade from static translations to CMS
2. **Inventory Integration**: Connect with existing inventory systems
3. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking and reporting
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications
5. **Advanced Personalization**: AI-driven product recommendations
6. **Social Features**: User reviews and social sharing

### Scalability Considerations
- Database sharding for large product catalogs
- Microservices architecture for complex features
- Advanced caching strategies
- CDN optimization for global users
- Load balancing for high traffic periods
